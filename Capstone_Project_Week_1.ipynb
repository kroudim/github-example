    "\n",
    "The aim of this report is to study and analyze the neighborhoods of Toronto city and group them into similar clusters and, to analyze those clusters to gather meaningful information. That information can be used to find out neighborhoods that are same as your current neighborhood or at least similar.This information provided by this report would be valuable for people who are interested in relocating to different part of the city and are looking to find new neighborhoods that are very similar to their existing neighborhood.\n",

Now say you receive a job offer from a great company on the other side of the city with great career prospects. However, given the far distance from your current place you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer.\n",
